## Sharing your extensions with others:
Create your extension first obviously, publish it to Github, Bitbucket, or other online git cloud.

Then send me an email with the link and I'll add that to the list of standard extensions in pyRevit repository. Here are the information that I'll need from you:

- Extension Name
- Extension Git Repository Link
- Single-line description
- Author's Name
- Author's online profile url
- Website url (Optional)
- Extension icon/logo url (Optional, PNG file)
