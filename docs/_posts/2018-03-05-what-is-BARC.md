## What is BARC model? ##
***BARC*** is the acronym for **B**oydens **ARC**hitectural model, a geometrical model developed in Revit. This approach brings us one step closer toward taking advantage of BIM to improve our work, affecting the way we all work. The BARC model was implemented in Boydens starting from the 1<sup>st</sup> of September 2017. More general information can be found in the ***presentation***.

[***Report Issues and suggest improvements***](https://github.com/chinh-trieutien/BARC/issues)

For the ones using it:
* It can be used in Concept Design and it will be used in Pre-Design, Detailed Design and Execution Design (the latter only in VN).
* Use the [***Reporting form***](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_gvDFP9-QiTeeFgQY2TNaeIK04qAEOu6fxaMTMvBJmFSh-g/viewform) for urgent (imperfections, ''have to'') and not urgent (want to have) issues. Automatically all of them will be gathered in a structured way towards the Internal Project team.
* Codes used in **General Planning**:
  * 0.1 BARC Model geometry
  * 1.1 Roombook in BARC Model
  * 1.2 Heatloss/Cooling load calculation liNear from BARC Model
  * 8.1 EPB/PEB extract from BARC Model
