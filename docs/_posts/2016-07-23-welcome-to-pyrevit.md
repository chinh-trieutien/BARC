Hello!!

Welcome to the pyRevit blog. I've been publishing changes and news to the github repository page for the past year but I feel it's time for pyRevit to have its own blog now.

So here is the first post :)

And oh btw, pyRevit has a nice logo now! It's an origami python since the new Revit logo is like an origami and python language logo is obviously two pythons.

From the sidebar, you can download the current installer and see a list of pages documenting different aspects of pyRevit.

From now on I'll post all the new changes and work-in-progress tools here.

Keep me posted on your thoughts!

Best,
