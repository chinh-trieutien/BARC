I also added a page describing the basic setup of a pyRevit script and the utilities that are available to it through `scriptutils` and `revitutils` modules. See the [Anatomy of a Script page]({{ site.url }}/pyRevit/anatomyofpyrevitscript).

Please keep in mind that pyRevit is a work in progress and we are always tweaking these these utilities to improve pyRevit.
