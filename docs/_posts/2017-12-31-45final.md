## v4.5 is here, Happy 2018

Hello!

As promised, pyRevit v4.5 is here and **v4.4 is officially retired / not supported / not available**. v4.5 is so much better trust me! :D

Watch the short video below on the most recent updates.

I have also moved a few pages from pyRevit blog to the new documentation. The updated pyRevit docs is [here](http://pyrevit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but it's still work-in-progress. The documentation is taking a lot longer than expected initially but I'm going to finish this before I touch anything else in pyRevit.

The next couple of videos will be on updated pyRevit features e.g. charts, logging, controlling output window. Stay tuned.

### Installation:

**I'd highly suggest removing all previous pyRevit versions and installing a fresh v4.5**

But, if you decided to use the `upgrade.bat` tool to upgrade the v4.4 installation in-place, please make sure to run the `install_addin.bat` script after the upgrade to correct the addin manifest file with the new location of the `pyRevitLoader.dll`

### Third-party Extensions:

pyRevit third-party extension still need to be updated so stay tuned until the developers update those for v4.5 and I'll add them back ASAP.
