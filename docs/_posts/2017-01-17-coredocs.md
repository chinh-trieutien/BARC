Now that the extension manager has been completed, it's time for next phase which is documenting the pyRevit core library, so all you Reviteers can dive in and contribute to the core, helping making it better for everyone.

Just so you know, I'll be using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) to compile the documentation from the [Google-style docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) in the source code. [Gui talarico](https://github.com/gtalarico) has also used Sphinx to create the documentation for the [RevitPythonWrapper](http://revitpythonwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

There are also a few `readme.md` files in the folders that gives you a basic understanding of how the repository is structured. They're markdown file and you can read them on a normal text editor but I highly suggest getting into the habit of using [Atom](https://atom.io) which is BTW the best text editor ever! Make sure you watch the video on the home page. It's brilliant!

Stay tuned...
