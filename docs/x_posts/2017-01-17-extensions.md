Okay,

Extension packages system is fully functional and we're officially in v4.1

&nbsp;

Open the Extension manager from the pyRevit slideout and give it a try.

- See [Adding your own scripts]({{ site.url }}/pyRevit/howtoaddscriptsandtabs) on how to create your own extensions 
- See [Sharing Extensions]({{ site.url }}/pyRevit/sharingextensions) on how to get your extensions added to the standard pyRevit extensions

Looking forward to see your awesome tools!
