I updated the `Show Nested Group Structure` tool today. Now it does what it's supposed to do and also prints a nicer output with links to the groups:


![]({{ site.url }}/pyRevit/images/shownestedgroupstruct2.png)

This tool works on selected elements of any kind (as long as they're groupable) and is very helpful in finding out the group structure around selected elements.

And here is where the tool is:
