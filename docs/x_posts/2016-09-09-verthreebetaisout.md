After weeks of work I am pleased to announce that version 3-beta of pyRevit is out.

[Please download the setup file from here](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases/download/v3betaSetup/pyRevitSetup-v3beta.exe) or from github [release page here](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit/releases).

You can install it anywhere you want however the default installation folder is `%appdata%/pyRevit/` and the package will be installed under `pyRevit-v3beta` folder. I like the user roaming folder since it makes the repository available at any machine I happen to log into.

I'm looking forward to hearing your comments...
