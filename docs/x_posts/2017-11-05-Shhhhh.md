Hey all,
I'm done with the changes on pyRevit v4.5-beta but making the video and writing the article on the changes is taking longer than expected.

Basically while writing the article I realized I really need to make a video on this to make it clear. There are not many changes, it's just that I need to explain some stuff so you understand the reasons better.

Give me two more days and I'll publish both soon.
