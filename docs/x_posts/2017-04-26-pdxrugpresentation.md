[Portland Revit User Group (pdxRUG)](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Revit-User-Group/) kindly allowed me to present pyRevit changes and updates at their April 2017 gathering. It went well except for me saying **'stuff like that'** too many times, and other bold statements which I'm sure I need to apologize for some of them someday. Forgive me Autodesk for I have sinned. :P

Anyway I had a good chance to talk about scripting for Revit basics and introduction to pyRevit tools. I also explained the overall structure of scripts and the usage logging system.

This partial video is about half-hour of the presentation on the basics of scripting for Revit and introduction to pyRevit, installation and configuration.

I also explained some of the tools but when editing the video, I realized it's better if I create a pyRevit youtube channel and actually post short videos on some of the more important tools. This way they'll be easier to find and watch. I was also running Revit in virtual machine on an Macbook and didn't have a proper Revit file open for tool presentation.

Therefore:

I ended up cutting all the tool presentation out of this video and I'll be posting individual tutorial videos about them shortly.

Thanks again to [pdxRUG](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Revit-User-Group/) and the attendees for joining me and for their questions and suggestions.
